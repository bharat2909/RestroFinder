# RestroFinder
It is an App built on Android Studio using Kotlin.  
Main functionality of it is that it displays Restaurant Names based on User's Input.  
I've implemented it using the latest technology like MVVM Architecture, ROOM database , DAGGER-HILT, Navigation Components.  
Designed a decent looking UI using XML with Constraint Layout in order to maintain Flat hierarchy.  

Usage:  
When the user opens the app, Main Activity with Home Fragment appears, in that certain views are present along with Search Bar.  
When the user clicks on the search Bar he/she will be navigated to Search Fragment, As soon user starts typing in search Bar he will get list of Restaurant names in Recycler View.  

Tools and Libraries Used:  
Glide, Gson , Material Design , Coroutines, Architectural Components.
